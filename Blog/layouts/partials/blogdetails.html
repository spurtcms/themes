            <p class="para__one">Handling timeouts and backpressure are critical aspects of building resilient
                stream processingapplications with Akka Streams. Implementing timeouts prevents infinite waiting
                periods while
                managing backpressure ensures system stability under varying loads. Strategies like using buffers,
                throttling and adaptive conflation help maintain system performance. Handling timeouts and

            <h2 class="heading__four">Managing Backpressure in Akka Streams</h2>
            <p class="para__one"> Backpressure is a mechanism that prevents overwhelming a system when the
                processing rate of downstream components cannot keep up with the incoming rate of data. Akka Streams
                handles backpressure automatically by signaling demand from consumers to producers. However,
                sometimes you need to manage backpressure explicitly, especially when dealing with non-Akka external
                systems that do not understand backpressure signals.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading__four">Coping with Slow Consumers</h2>
            <p class="para__one"> Sometimes you might encounter slow consumers that cannot process elements as fast
                as they are emitted. In such cases, time-based backpressure strategies like throttle can be useful:
            </p>

            <code class="blogDetail__code">
               <p class="para__one"> val elementsPerSecond = 1</p>
               <p class="para__one"> Source(1 to 100) </p>
               <p class="para__one"> .throttle(elementsPerSecond, 1.second)</p>
                 <p class="para__one">.runWith(Sink.foreach(println))</p>
            </code>
            <p class="para__one">The throttle method limits the number of elements passing downstream per time unit,
                thereby ensuring that your consumer is not overwhelmed.</p>


            <h2 class="heading__four">Tackling Resource Saturation with Backpressure Strategies</h2>
            <p class="para__one"> In cases where buffering and throttling are insufficient, you might need to
                consider backpressure strategies that adaptively control the flow based on resource saturation. One
                such strategy is the use of conflate, which combines elements during high load periods:
            </p>

            <code class="blogDetail__code">

                <p class="para__one"> Source(1 to 100)</p>
                <p class="para__one"> .conflateWithSeed(Seq(_))((acc, elem) => acc :+ elem)</p>
                <p class="para__one"> .map { batch => </p>
                <p class="para__one">// Process batch</p>
                <p class="para__one">}</p>
                <p class="para__one">.runWith(Sink.ignore)</p>

                </code>
            <p class="para__one">This approach allows your stream to adapt its processing rate dynamically based on
                current system load, preventing resource exhaustion.</p>
